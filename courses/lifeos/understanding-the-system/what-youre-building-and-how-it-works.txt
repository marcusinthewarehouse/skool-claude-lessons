What You're Building and How It Works

What is an Agentic Workspace?

An agentic workspace is a folder of markdown files that gives your AI:

- Memory - It remembers everything across sessions
- Identity - It knows who you are and how you work
- Schedule - It knows when things happen
- Skills - It knows how to help with specific tasks
- Autonomy - It knows what it can do without asking

Result: Your AI drafts emails before you check your inbox, works on research while you sleep, and surfaces only what needs your attention.


The Daily Cycle

Your AI operates in four modes that flow naturally through the day:

MORNING REVIEW (8:00-8:30 AM) - Weather, calendar, emails, messages. Tasks organized by time block. Drafts ready for approval.

DAYTIME HEARTBEATS (Every 30 minutes) - Check inboxes, surface urgent items, stay quiet if nothing needs attention.

EVENING REVIEW (Before bed) - Day summary, self-evaluation, overnight work proposals.

NIGHTTIME MODE (While you sleep) - Autonomous research and prep. No external actions. Morning briefing ready when you wake.

Clawdbot users: This happens automatically via cron jobs and heartbeats.

Claude Code users: You trigger each mode manually using commands like "morning review", "heartbeat", "evening review". The system works identically - you just drive it instead of autopilot.


Self-Improvement Loops

The system gets better over time through built-in feedback mechanisms:

Evening Self-Evaluation: Every night, the AI rates itself on Usefulness, Proactivity, Accuracy, Communication, and Learning (1-5 scale). This creates accountability and drives daily improvement.

Memory Accumulation: Daily logs capture what happened, long-term memory extracts patterns. The more you use it, the better it knows you.
