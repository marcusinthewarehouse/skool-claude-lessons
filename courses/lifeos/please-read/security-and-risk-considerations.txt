Security & Risk Considerations

ClawdBot/Claude Code has significant access to your machine. When you grant it permissions, it can:

- Read and write files anywhere on your filesystem
- Read your emails (if you connect email tools)
- Read and send messages (if you connect messaging tools)
- Read and modify your calendar (if you connect calendar tools)
- Execute code and shell commands
- Browse the web

This orchestration system grants additional autonomous agency. The agent will:

- Make decisions about what to surface to you
- Work autonomously while you sleep (if enabled)
- Draft communications on your behalf
- Organize and modify your files
- Execute tasks without asking (within the autonomy boundaries you set)

What Could Go Wrong

- Wrong email sent to wrong person
- Files modified or deleted unintentionally
- Private data processed by AI systems
- Autonomous actions taken that you didn't anticipate
- Calendar events created at wrong times
- Messages sent without proper review

How to Mitigate Risk

- Start with TIGHT autonomy - Begin with minimal permissions
- Review everything - Don't auto-approve until you trust the system
- Test in isolation - Run heartbeats manually before enabling automation
- Expand gradually - Add permissions only after proven behavior
- Keep secrets separate - Don't put credentials in workspace files

Liability

This system is provided as-is. You use it at your own risk. The creator is not responsible for data loss, privacy breaches, unintended actions, or any other consequences of using this system.


This System is Experimental

Version 1.0 - Newly Created

This is a new system that is actively evolving. You should expect:

- Edge cases that aren't handled well
- Documentation gaps
- Workflows that may need adjustment
- Bugs and rough edges

Your Feedback Shapes Development

This system will improve based on community input. Please:

- Post issues in the Skool community - What's not working?
- Share what's working - What patterns are successful?
- Suggest improvements - What would make this better?
- Report bugs with details - Help us fix problems

Updates will be pushed to the repo as we learn what works. Check back for new versions. Feel free to submit pull requests.


Expect Significant Customization Work

This is a framework, not plug-and-play software.

Time Investment Required:

- Quick setup: 15-20 minutes (basic config, limited features)
- Standard setup: 45-60 minutes (full config, most features)
- Full functionality: Many hours over days/weeks

The system needs to learn your schedule, communication preferences, projects, priorities, autonomy comfort level, and integration requirements. This can't be done in one session - you'll iterate.

It's All Markdown - Change Everything. The entire system is stored in markdown files and JSON. There is no compiled code, no hidden logic. Experiment. Break things. Rebuild to suit you.


Clawdbot vs Claude Code

This system works with both Clawdbot and Claude Code, but was designed initially for Clawdbot.

Clawdbot is an always-on AI daemon with automatic heartbeats every 30 minutes via cron jobs, scheduled morning/evening reviews, and background processes. With Clawdbot, the system runs on autopilot.

Claude Code is the on-demand CLI tool. Everything works, you just invoke it manually instead of it invoking itself. Many users prefer this level of control.

Manual triggers for Claude Code: "morning review", "evening review", "heartbeat", "check email", "check calendar"

The agent self-identifies which platform it's running on during onboarding by checking for Clawdbot daemon processes, config files, and environment variables.


Summary

- Understand the risks - This has real power, use carefully
- It's experimental - Help shape it with feedback
- Invest the time - Customization is required
- Test first - Don't trust until proven
- Make it yours - Everything is changeable
- Know your platform - Clawdbot = autopilot, Claude Code = manual
