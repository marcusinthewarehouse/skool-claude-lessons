Reference

Quick reference for file formats, folder structure, and key concepts.


Folder Structure

- tasks/ - Your task queue with _inbox/, work/, personal/ subfolders.
- skills/ - Reusable protocols with SKILL.md files.
- memory/ - Daily logs (YYYY-MM-DD.md).
- projects/ - Project context files (CONTEXT.md per project).
- Root files: SOUL.md, USER.md, SCHEDULE.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md.


Core Files

- SOUL.md - AI personality, principles, and behavioral guidelines.
- USER.md - Your background, goals, preferences, and context.
- SCHEDULE.md - Daily time blocks (protected, recurring, schedulable).
- MEMORY.md - Long-term curated knowledge.
- HEARTBEAT.md - What to check during automated heartbeats.


Task Metadata

Each task file has YAML frontmatter: priority (high/medium/low), status (todo/in-progress/blocked/done), domain (work/personal), assigned (human/agent), due (optional deadline), project (optional link to project context).


Autonomy Boundaries

AI can do autonomously: research, draft, organize, update tasks/memory, git commits to branches, create PRs.

AI asks first: send emails/messages, add calendar events, delete files, merge PRs, push to main, any external action.
