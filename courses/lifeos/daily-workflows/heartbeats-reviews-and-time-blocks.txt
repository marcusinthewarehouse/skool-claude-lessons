Daily Workflows

Heartbeats, reviews, and time blocks - how your AI operates throughout the day.


The Heartbeat

The heartbeat is a scheduled check-in that runs throughout the day (every 30 minutes by default). Each heartbeat: commits any uncommitted changes, checks what mode to be in based on time, and routes to the appropriate action.

Most heartbeats produce nothing - that's good. You only hear from your AI when there's actually something to tell you.


Morning Review

Your daily briefing when you wake up. Covers: weather, calendar for the day, emails processed with drafts ready, messages surfaced, tasks organized by time block, and summary of what AI did overnight.


Evening Review

Closes out the day before you sleep. Covers: day summary of what got done, memory updates, and overnight task proposals. You approve which tasks the agent can work on while you sleep.


Autonomy Boundaries

What your AI can do without asking:

DO autonomously: Research, read, analyze, draft (not send), organize files, update tasks/memory, git commits to branches, create PRs

ASK FIRST: Send emails/messages, add calendar events, delete files, merge PRs, push to main/production, any external action

This is configurable. Start tight, expand as you trust the system.
