The Meta-Prompt (Download)

What the Meta-Prompt Does

The meta-prompt is a specialized instruction file that tells Claude Code how to generate complete implementation roadmaps from your software ideas.

When you paste the meta-prompt along with your software idea, Claude will:

1. Ask clarifying questions about your project
2. Analyze the scope and complexity
3. Break down the work into 40-150 atomic tasks
4. Generate complete code snippets for each task
5. Include all tests, validation, and quality checks
6. Create a roadmap document ready for execution


The Strategy

The meta-prompt creates a three-tier orchestration system:

TIER 1: Roadmap Generation
Claude analyzes your idea and generates the complete plan

TIER 2: Main Orchestrator
A separate Claude instance manages task execution sequentially

TIER 3: Task Agents
Individual agents complete specific tasks with full testing

This separation ensures each component focuses on its specialty, producing production-ready code.


How to Use It

1. Open Claude Code
2. Type: "I want to build [your software idea]"
3. Paste the entire meta-prompt file content after your software idea
4. Answer Claude's clarifying questions
5. Save the generated roadmap document
