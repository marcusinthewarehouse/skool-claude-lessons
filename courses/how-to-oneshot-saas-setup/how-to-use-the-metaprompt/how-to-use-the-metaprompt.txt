How to Use the Meta-Prompt

Build production software in hours, not weeks.

The simple process:

1. Tell Claude Code your software idea
Open Claude Code and describe what you want to build in plain English.

2. Paste the meta-prompt
Copy the meta-prompt file (attached in the next lesson) and paste it into Claude Code along with your idea.

3. Get your roadmap
Claude will generate a complete implementation roadmap document with every task detailed.

4. Start a new Claude Code session
Open a fresh Claude Code window (important: new session, not the same one).

5. Paste the roadmap and let it run
Copy the entire roadmap document and paste it into the new Claude Code session. It will start building your software automatically.

6. Monitor the build
Watch as Claude Code works through each task. Sometimes it will pause. Just tell it to continue when this happens.

7. Validate and iterate
When it's done, test the software. If something needs fixing, tell Claude what to change and it will update the code.


That's it. No coding required.
