Welcome to Claude Code Skills

What are Claude Code Skills?
Claude Code Skills are modular packages that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tool integrations. Each skill transforms Claude into a domain expert for specific tasks.

Think of skills as "superpowers" you can give Claude. Want Claude to create professional designs? Load the Design skills. Need help with backend architecture? Activate the Engineering skills.


How Skills Work
Each skill is a self-contained package that includes:

- SKILL.md - The core skill instructions and knowledge.
- Scripts - Executable code for automation and processing
- References - Documentation and domain knowledge
- Assets - Templates, fonts, and resources

When you load a skill into Claude Code, Claude gains access to all this specialized knowledge and can use it to help you accomplish tasks in that domain.
