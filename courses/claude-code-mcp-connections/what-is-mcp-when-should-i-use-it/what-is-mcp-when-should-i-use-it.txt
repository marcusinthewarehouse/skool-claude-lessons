What is MCP? When should I use it?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is how Claude Code connects safely to outside tools and services like databases, browsers, or context libraries, without needing special plugins or risky API calls.

Think of MCP as a "universal adapter" that lets your AI work with any external system through small add-on servers called MCP servers.

When to use MCP

Use MCP whenever you want Claude Code to do something beyond reading or writing code:

- Access other websites and apps, data or APIs
- Automate testing or browser actions
- Work with large external context (PDFs, notes, docs)

You don't need it for simple coding tasks, but once your agent needs real-world access, MCP is the bridge.


Why MCP matters

Normally, Claude Code can only see your text files, chat and search the web.
With MCP, it can:

- Query a real database (like Supabase)
- Search stored library documentation or research (using Context 7)
- Open a browser to test or scrape a site or automate testing (using Playwright)

Each of these abilities comes from an MCP server you install and connect once.


Next steps in this course

The following pages include ready-to-copy setup commands to link three essential MCP servers for this workflow:

1. Supabase Server
Lets Claude Code read and write to your Supabase database and storage.
Used for: queries, schema checks, migrations.

2. Context_7 Server
Lets Claude Code find the most recent library documentation so it doesn't hallucinate code.
Used for: context search and retrieval.

3. Playwright Server
Gives Claude Code the ability to use a browser for testing or collecting data.
Used for: running web tests, screenshots, scraping.

Each setup page will show:
- How to add the server to your .mcp.json
- The basic environment variables to set
- A quick test command to confirm it works

After completing them, Claude Code will be connected to your database, context sources, and your browser, forming the foundation of your full AI workflow.
