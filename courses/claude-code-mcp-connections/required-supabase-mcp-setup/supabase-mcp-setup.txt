REQUIRED: Supabase MCP Setup

Follow these steps to get a Supabase Personal Access Token (PAT) and wire it into your project's MCP config.


1) Create a Supabase Personal Access Token

Open the Supabase Dashboard and go to Account > Access Tokens.

Click Generate new token, give it a name, set expiration (optional), and Create.

Copy the token (it usually starts with spb...). Keep it secret.

Find the .mcp.json file in your project root that was created after executing the commands from the previous pages' instructions.

Your earlier claude mcp add --scope project ... commands created/updated a .mcp.json file in your project root. This file is what Claude Code reads to start project-scoped servers.


3) Replace the placeholder with your real token

Open ./.mcp.json, find the Supabase server entry, and replace the placeholder token with your real one.

Example (your file may include extra fields, just update the token value):

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest", "--access-token", "sbp_your_real_token_here"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "sbp_your_real_token_here"
      },
      "transport": "stdio",
      "scope": "project"
    }
  }
}


4) Restart Claude Code

You have to restart Claude Code for any configuration changes to take effect. Type "/exit" to Claude Code. Then, start up Claude Code again, and type "mcp", and you should see green check marks next to the Supabase MCP server.


5) Quick test

Ask Claude Code:
"Use the Supabase MCP to list my projects or run a read-only SQL to test the MCP's functionality"
If it responds with data (or a permission prompt), your setup is working.
