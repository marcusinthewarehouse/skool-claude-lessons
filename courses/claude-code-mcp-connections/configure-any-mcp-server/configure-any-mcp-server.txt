Configure Any MCP Server

There are many MCP servers you can connect to: databases, apps, browsers, APIs, and more.

If you want Claude Code to connect to an external app or tool, just paste the prompt below into Claude Code, making sure to replace {SERVICE_NAME} with the name of the MCP server or service you want to connect (for example: Notion, Postgres, Slack, S3, Airtable, etc.).

Claude Code will:

- Find the official or most reliable MCP server for that service
- Configure it at the project level
- Tell you which environment variables or tokens you need

Once you've set them, just restart Claude Code to start using the new MCP server


Copy-Paste Prompt for Claude Code:

You are my MCP setup assistant for Claude Code.

Goal: Configure an MCP server for {SERVICE_NAME} at the PROJECT scope in this repository, following official installation instructions exactly.

Reference links:
- Anthropic documentation for Claude Code MCP configuration:
  https://docs.claude.ai/claude-code/mcp
- Official community MCP server list:
  https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers

Instructions:
1. Search the GitHub MCP server directory and, if needed, GitHub at large to locate an official or well-maintained MCP server for {SERVICE_NAME}.
2. Open its README and identify the correct installation command, transport type (stdio or http), and required setup.
3. Create the correct Claude Code configuration command PRIORITIZING the configuration listed in the documentation that you find, or if none listed, this structure:
   `claude mcp add --scope project --transport stdio {SERVER_NAME} -- npx -y {PACKAGE_NAME}@latest`
   Include any required environment variables using `--env KEY=VALUE`. Then, run the command.
4. Reply with:
   - All required **environment variables** and step by step instructions of where to find them (find this via websearch) I must create or set (with short descriptions of what each does)
5. End by reminding me to restart Claude Code so it loads the new server.

Constraints:
- Always use official or trusted sources.
- Keep your instructions clear and beginner-friendly.

Once Claude Code gives you the commands, run them in your project terminal, set any required environment variables, and restart Claude Code.
Your new MCP server will now be connected and ready to use.
