M2C1 - Fully Autonomous Development Framework

M2C1 (measure twice cut once) is a Claude Code skill that turns your brain dump into fully built, tested, and deployed software. You describe your idea, and it handles everything else through coordinated AI subagents.

WHAT IT DOES

The framework runs a 12-phase orchestration workflow. It converts your idea into a structured PRD, deploys parallel research subagents, asks you detailed discovery questions, configures all tools and MCP servers, creates a master implementation plan, shards it into individual task files, reviews them for coherence, then autonomously executes every task with comprehensive testing at every level.

THE 12 PHASES

1. Setup - Creates orchestration folder structure
2. Brain Dump to PRD - Synthesizes your idea into a structured spec
3. First Research Wave - Parallel subagents research every domain
4. Discovery Questions - Detailed Q&A to clarify all decisions
5. Second Research Wave - Implementation-focused research
6. Tool Setup - Configures MCP servers, API keys, services
7. Tool Verification - Tests every tool and integration
8. Skill Creation - Creates project-level skills for each domain
9. Context Compact - Refresh context (all state is in files)
10. Master Plan - Implementation plan with tasks and dependencies
11. Task Sharding - Expands each task into a self-contained agent prompt
12. Final Artifacts - Creates progress tracker, orchestrator, and project config

After setup completes, run /start and the orchestrator autonomously executes every task with full testing.

KEY PRINCIPLES

- Every artifact has a template
- Parallel by default - subagents run in background wherever independent
- Multi-angle testing at every level
- Human-emulating testing via Playwright
- Tool-aware - researches and configures MCP servers and CLIs
- Generalizable - works for SaaS, API, CLI, mobile, and more

INSTALLATION

Clone the repo and copy into your Claude Code skills directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/grandamenium/m2c1.git
cp -r m2c1/ ~/.claude/skills/m2c1/
```

Claude Code will auto-discover the skill. Just describe your project idea and the 12-phase workflow kicks off automatically.
