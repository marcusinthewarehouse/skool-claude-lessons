Summary

The Short Form Video Scraper is a Python-based pipeline that turns TikTok videos into structured, searchable knowledge. It was built as a Claude Code project, meaning you interact with it entirely through claude code slash commands in your terminal.


How It Works

The tool runs a four-stage pipeline on each video:

1. Scrape - Extracts video metadata (URLs, titles, view counts) from a TikTok profile using yt-dlp
2. Download - Downloads the audio track as MP3 with retry logic and fallback formats
3. Transcribe - Runs OpenAI Whisper locally to convert audio to text. No API calls needed
4. Summarize - Claude Code reads transcripts and generates topic-classified summaries with key tips and details


What You Get

After processing, your output folder contains:

- Raw transcripts in transcripts/ with metadata headers
- Summaries organized by topic in summaries/ with YAML frontmatter
- A master INDEX.md grouping everything by topic
- State tracking in state/ so re-runs skip already-processed videos

The tool is fully idempotent. Run it as many times as you want and it will only process new videos.
