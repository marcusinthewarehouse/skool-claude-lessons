Features

Here is everything the Short Form Video Scraper can do, broken down by slash command.


/start - Environment Setup
Automates first-time setup: creates a virtual environment, installs all dependencies, checks for ffmpeg, and runs tests to verify everything works.

/bulk - Full Profile Processing
Processes all videos from a TikTok profile in one shot. Scrapes the profile, downloads audio, transcribes with Whisper, and generates topic-organized summaries. Tracks progress so you can resume if interrupted.

/transcribe - Single Video Processing
Paste one or more TikTok URLs and get transcripts plus summaries for just those videos. Perfect for processing specific content without scraping an entire profile.

/accounts - Account Management
Multi-Account Management
Add, remove, switch between, and process multiple TikTok profiles. Keeps each account organized separately.

/skillify - Knowledge Extraction
Converts your transcript summaries into reusable Claude Code skill files. Enriches them with web research so the resulting skills contain actionable, verified knowledge you can use in future sessions.
