GitHub Repo & Setup

The Short Form Video Scraper is fully open-source. Everything you need is in the GitHub repo.


Repository
https://github.com/grandamenium/short-form-video-transcriber


Start with Claude Code

The easiest way to get started is to tell Claude Code to clone the repo and run the setup command. Open Claude Code in your terminal and type:

Clone https://github.com/grandamenium/short-form-video-transcriber and run /start

Claude will clone the repository, set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and verify everything works. Once setup is complete, you can use any of the slash commands listed in the Features page.


Manual Setup

If you prefer to set things up yourself:

git clone https://github.com/grandamenium/short-form-video-transcriber.git
cd short-form-video-transcriber
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
brew install ffmpeg  # macOS

No API keys are needed for the core workflow. Whisper runs locally and Claude Code handles summarization. If you want to use the optional API-based summarizer, set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in your .env file.
