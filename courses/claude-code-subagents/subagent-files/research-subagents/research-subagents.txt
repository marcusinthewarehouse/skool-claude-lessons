Research Subagents

Research agents help you understand code and gather information before you start building.

Agents in this folder:

external context researcher
Gathers documentation and implementation guides when you need to use external APIs, libraries, or frameworks. Saves you from hours of manual research by collecting official documentation and creating ready to use examples.

codebase explorer
Maps out your existing code to help you understand how things work. Finds relevant files, extracts code snippets, and shows you what changed recently so you can build new features that fit with what already exists.

project architect
Sets up the folder structure and configuration files when starting a brand new project. Creates a solid foundation with best practices so you can start coding immediately instead of spending hours on setup.
