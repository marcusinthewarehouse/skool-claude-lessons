Documentation Subagents

Documentation agents create and maintain written guides that explain how your code works.

Agents in this folder:

docs weaver
Automatically generates documentation after you build features or change APIs. Pulls working code examples from your tests and keeps everything in sync so documentation never gets outdated.

project historian
Creates checkpoint snapshots after major changes to your codebase. Documents what changed, why it matters, and what risks to watch for. Acts like a time machine for understanding your project's evolution.
