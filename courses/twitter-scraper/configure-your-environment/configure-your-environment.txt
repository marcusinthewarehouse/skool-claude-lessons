Configure Your Environment

Now let's set up your local environment. This involves downloading the project, creating your configuration file, and organizing your credentials.

For this and all of the following pages, have Claude Code execute the commands!


Step 1: Create Your Google Drive Folder

1. Go to https://drive.google.com
2. Create a new folder (e.g., "AI Video Scripts")
3. Open the folder and look at the URL
4. Copy the folder ID (the long string after /folders/)


Step 2: Download the Project Files

Click the "Download Project Files" link at the bottom of this page to get the project. Extract it to a folder on your computer.


Step 3: Save Your OAuth Credentials

Find the JSON file you downloaded from Google Cloud, rename it to oauth-credentials.json, and move it to the config/ folder in your project.


Step 4: Create Your .env File

In the project folder, copy .env.example to .env and fill in your values:

APIFY_API_TOKEN=apify_api_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR_KEY_HERE
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=YOUR_FOLDER_ID_HERE
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./config/oauth-credentials.json

Your folder structure should now have the .env file at the root and oauth-credentials.json in the config folder.
