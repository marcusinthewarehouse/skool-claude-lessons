Get Your API Keys

You'll need two API keys to power your pipeline: one from Apify (for scraping tweets) and one from Anthropic (for Claude AI script generation).


Step 1: Get Your Apify API Token

1. Go to https://apify.com and create a free account
2. After signing in, click on Settings in the left sidebar
3. Click on Integrations
4. Copy your Personal API Token (starts with apify_api_)
5. Save this token - you'll need it later


Step 2: Get Your Anthropic API Key

1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys in your account settings
4. Click Create Key and give it a name like "Content Pipeline"
5. Copy the key (starts with sk-ant-api03-)
6. Save this key securely - you won't be able to see it again


Important Notes

- Both services have free tiers that are more than enough to get started
- Keep your API keys private - never share them or commit them to public repositories
- You can set spending limits in both dashboards to avoid unexpected charges
