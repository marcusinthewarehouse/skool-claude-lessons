First Run & Testing

You're almost there! Let's install dependencies, authorize Google, and run your first pipeline.


Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open Terminal, navigate to your project folder, and install dependencies:

cd ~/Desktop/tweet-scraper
npm install


Step 2: Authorize Google Access

This is a one-time process that authorizes the app to access your Google Drive.

node scripts/authorize-google.js

This will:
- Open your browser to Google's login page
- Ask you to sign in with your Google account
- Show a consent screen - click Allow
- Redirect you back with a success message

After authorization, a new file config/oauth-token.json will be created. This stores your refresh token for automated access.

Note: If you see "Access blocked" error, make sure you added your email as a test user in the OAuth consent screen (Step 4 of Google Cloud Setup).


Step 3: Test the Pipeline

Now run the full pipeline:

npm start

This will:
- Scrape tweets from all influencers (takes 5-7 minutes)
- Send tweets to Claude for script generation (about 30 seconds)
- Upload a formatted Google Doc to your Drive folder


Step 4: Check Your Results

Open your Google Drive folder. You should see a new document with today's date containing your generated video scripts!

Congratulations! Your AI content pipeline is working. The next lesson covers how to automate it to run daily.
